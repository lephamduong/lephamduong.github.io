An essential part of logistic regression is the sigmoid function. By mapping predicted values to probabilities, it ensures that the result stays between 0 and 1. Any real value can be entered into this function, and it will output a probability score. The sigmoid curve has an "S"-like visual representation.

The sigmoid function's mathematical expression looks like below:

Key Properties of the Sigmoid Function
## 1. Output Range: 
One of the most crucial properties of the sigmoid function is its output range. For any real number input the sigmoid function outputs values strictly between 0 and 1. This characteristic makes it especially useful for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict probabilities.

## 2. S-Shaped Curve:
The sigmoid function creates an S-shaped curve. When plotted, the curve transitions smoothly from 0 to 1, with a point of maximum steepness at 0
z=0. This steepness is crucial for distinguishing between probabilities close to 0 and those close to 1, providing a clear gradient for the learning algorithm to work with.

## 3. Gradient and Derivative: 
The sigmoid function’s gradient is another important property. The derivative of the sigmoid function can be expressed as:

This property is essential for optimization algorithms like gradient descent, as it helps in adjusting the model parameters during training.
